    Shitware. Will take up 0.1~0.2% (0.13% on average) CPU even on a computer without any microphones.

    Even disabling the device does not stop the service from running. Fortunatly, at least Armoury Crate won't install it back automatically (instead it will prompt `A required driver is missing`).
